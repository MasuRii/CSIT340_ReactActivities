# E-Bingo Application

## Overview

E-Bingo is a web-based Bingo application built with React. It allows players to join Bingo games, manage multiple Bingo cards, manually highlight numbers, and check for wins. The application interacts with external REST APIs to fetch Bingo cards and verify winning conditions.

## Features

- **Join a Bingo Game:** Enter a game code to join an existing Bingo game.
- **Manage Multiple Cards:** Players can add and manage multiple Bingo cards simultaneously.
- **Manual Highlighting:** Manually highlight numbers on your Bingo cards as they are called.
- **Automatic Highlighting:** Automatically highlight numbers that have been called in the game.
- **Check for Wins:** Verify if any of your Bingo cards have achieved a winning condition.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application
